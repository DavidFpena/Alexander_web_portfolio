A photographer contacted me to create a website to display his portfolio of photographies. He gave me full artistic freedom for this project.

-I decided to go for a minimalistic UI/UX design so that the focus would be on the photographer's work.

-This project helped me develop even further my frontend skills, I used plenty of bootstrap code
to make the website fully responsive with the bootstrap grid design. I also used dynamic sizing on the website's elements to increase the responsiveness.

-I worked using css to add some animations to the website which added focus to the photos displayed and made the navigation on the website more interactive.


### Built With

<!-- TODO: List any MAJOR libraries/frameworks (e.g. React, Tailwind) with links to their homepages. -->

The framework used for the development of this website was [RubyOnRails 7](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/7_0_release_notes.html).

The frontend portion of the website was developed using [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) and [bootstrap5](https://getbootstrap.com). To be able to use bootstrap elements that need js, I used popper js.
